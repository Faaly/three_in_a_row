# three_in_a_row
The goal behind this little project is to learn the language C# and use newly learned concepts such as classes, functions, and more right away in my project. 
Also to improve my understanding in Github and Visual Studio.

# Overview
Three_in_a_row is a small, turn-based terminal game for two players. The objective is to place your markers on a 4x4 board. However, if you have three of the same symbols in a rowâ€”vertically, horizontally, or diagonallyâ€”you lose. If the entire board is filled and neither player has lost, the game ends in a draw.
